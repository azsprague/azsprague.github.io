    <h3>This Website!</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/azsprague/azsprague.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #555">Repository</a>
    <p>
        Over Winter break, I decided it was time to have my own website; a place for my thoughts, ideas, and projects to
        land. I explored a few different avenues, but ultimately decided to go with GitHub Pages to host the site. They
        make it <i>super</i> simple to get everything up and running, and even offer 1Gb of storage for free. Maybe I'll
        write a how-to on the process someday...
    </p>
    <p>
        The nuts and bolts of the site are also relatively rudimentary. Since everything on the website is static (i.e.
        nothing is drastically changing), I only really need HTML with a little bit of CSS and JavaScript for flair.
        This whole site is a work in progress; it's my first endeavor into building a website from scratch, so there's
        still plenty that I'm learning and changing everyday. I know it seems right out of the late 2000's right now,
        but you just wait.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        Bonus Two Cents: my go-to IDE for web development is Webstorm from JetBrains
        (<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>). IMO, it's
        more intuitive and fluid that VS Code (and sometimes it's nice to be different than everybody else).

    <h3>Financial Organization System</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/azsprague/Financial-Organization-System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #555">Repository</a>
    <p>
        Being the Treasurer for one club and running a chunk of the financials for another, I figured it would be
        worthwhile to design something that could assist me with keeping funds and purchases in order; that's why I
        set out to make this system. Utilizing a local SQL database, this java program allows me to perform most of
        the operations I need to keep track of club financials, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding a Fund</li>
        <li>Inputting a Purchase</li>
        <li>Looking up Fund Amounts</li>
        <li>Looking up Purchase History</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        And more. In theory, I could just use an excel spreadsheet to keep track of this information, however this
        system is more streamlined and faster to find specific data (for my uses at least). More information about the
        system itself and the source code can be found at the link to the repository above.
    </p>

    <h3>Automated Email System</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/azsprague/Automated-Email-System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #555">Repository</a>
    <p>
        This project started out more as a joke between me and my friends. We wanted a way to send repeated texts to
        each other without having to send them ourselves, so we set out to make a system to do it. Our first rendition
        was finished in the Spring of 2020, and while it got the job done, it was largely a mess and was inevitably
        forgotten. A few months ago, however, I found the code on my laptop and decided that I would take the time to
        clean it up and optimize things.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        The current system today has been redesigned to be an automated messaging system that will send either a one-time
        or daily reminder to any number of recipients. Instead of simply a joke amongst friends, I actually can use
        this code to text me at certain times of day to remember things I would otherwise forget. More information about
        the system itself and the source code can be found at the link to the repository above.

    <h3>Java BlackJack (With GUI)</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/azsprague/Blackjack-Java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #555">Repository</a>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        My version of Blackjack may not be the prettiest that you'll ever see, but considering it's using standard
        Java library classes and methods, I'm proud of it. It uses standard casino blackjack rules, has a decent
        looking GUI, and runs like a charm.
    </p>

    <h3>Java Hangman (Text-Based)</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/azsprague/Hangman-Java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #555">Repository</a>
    <p>
        I made this game in the Spring of 2020 as a fun project, nothing too serious; it's just a fun, simple
        version of Hangman that runs in your terminal.
