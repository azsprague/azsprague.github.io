    <h2>Backend:</h2>
    <h3>Java:</h3>
    <h5>Proficiency: 8/10</h5>
    <p>
        Java is definitely my most fluent and confident language; it was the first that I learned, and is generally
        my go-to for moderate to large size systems. Given enough time (and access to Stack Overflow), I could create
        just about anything in this language.
    </p>

    <h3>C:</h3>
    <h5>Proficiency: 5/10</h5>
    <p>
        C is newer to me; I've only spent a few months working with it, however I've picked it up rather quickly.
        The memory management takes a little bit of getting used to, but I respect the power that this language can
        pack.
    </p>

    <h3>C#:</h3>
    <h5>Proficiency: 5/10</h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        C# is pretty similar to Java in a lot of ways and thus was not difficult for me to pick up. I began to learn
        this language for an endeavor into video game development and found it to be quite nice, however my experience
        is limited.
    </p>

    <h2>Frontend:</h2>
    <h3>HTML:</h3>
    <h5>Proficiency: 8/10</h5>
    <p>
        After making this website, HTML comes very naturally to me. It's a straightforward and simple markup language
        that gets the job done. Enough said.
    </p>

    <h3>CSS:</h3>
    <h5>Proficiency: 6/10</h5>
    <p>
        CSS is a little more elusive than HTML, with more commands and the addition of animations and other special
        manipulations. I learned a lot while making this site, but there's still a lot to learn.
    </p>

    <h3>JavaScript:</h3>
    <h5>Proficiency: 4/10</h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        JavaScript syntax is easy to pick up, but the actual usage has a ton that I'm just beginning to learn. I only
        use it sparingly in this site, but I know it can be used to host entire back-ends on its own.
    </p>

    <h2>Other:</h2>
    <h3>Python:</h3>
    <h5>Proficiency: 7/10</h5>
    <p>
        Python is my go-to language for quick prototyping and small programs. It's super easy to use and learn, there
        are libraries for almost any application, and it works with just about everything.
    </p>

    <h3>MATLAB:</h3>
    <h5>Proficiency: 5/10</h5>
    <p>
        I only used MATLAB for my first year at Virginia Tech, but it wasn't too hard to learn and is definitely
        king for scientific work and data modeling.
    </p>

    <h3>AWS:</h3>
    <h5>Proficiency: 3/10</h5>
    <p>
        As of January 2020, I've started learning the Amazon Web Services suite and plan on <b>eventually</b>
        earning several certifications, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Certified Cloud Practitioner</li>
        <li>Certified Developer - Associate</li>
        <li>Certified Solutions Architect - Associate</li>
        <li>Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I'm still in the very early stages of learning, however I hope to finish everything by the start of the 2021-22
        academic year.
