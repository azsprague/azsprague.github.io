    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm an aspiring Software Developer, UX Designer, and Entrepreneur from the Northern Virginia
        area. I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Virginia Tech with a minor in Human-Computer
        Interaction and a focus in Artificial Intelligence. On campus, I currently serve as the Project
        Manager for Design Build Fly, an engineering design team, as well as the Treasurer for the
        Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning club. I'm currently working as a Computer Science
        intern at AnaVation LLC for the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Software design has been a big passion of mine for years. To me, creating a system, algorithm,
        or website yourself is almost its own form of art; the satisfaction that comes from seeing something
        that you made being used and enjoyed by others is second to none. I have skills in developing
        systems in Java, Python, C, and C#, as well as web development experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        Working in a team of four developers, our group is tasked with creating a Remote Access Tool (RAT) to
        be used in Penetration Testing and ethical hacking. We follow the Agile/Scrum methodology in order
        to ensure the delivery of a useful and successful product.

        I joined the AI/ML club at the beginning of the Fall 2020 semester as just a member so I could get some
        better hands-on experience with the field. We went over a bunch of interesting topics including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditional Neural Networks</li>
        <li>Convolutional Neural Networks</li>
        <li>Image Recognition</li>
        <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
        <li>Ensemble Learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        I also gained experience using software such as Orange to better visualize the whole process. Towards the
        end of the semester, I applied (and was accepted) to be the club Treasurer; I serve alongside 4 other students,
        and together we are responsible for creating the club events and projects for each meeting. As the Treasurer,
        I am personally responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        <li>Allocating All Club Funding</li>
        <li>Creating a Club Budget</li>
        <li>Managing and Dispersing Funds</li>
        <li>Collaborating with Other Leaders on Club Direction</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design Build Fly at VT - Project Manager</h3>
    <h5>

    <p>
        DBF was the first club I joined at Virginia Tech; each year, we create an unmanned, electric powered,
        radio-controlled aircraft to be applied to "real world" missions. It's a pretty substantial task which involves
        months of work and dozens of workers, so members are divided into sub-teams where they focus on specific parts
        of the process. As a Freshman, I joined the Manufacturing team - we were responsible for creating the physical
        plane from the CAD models.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alongside Manufacturing, I shadowed the club's Student Engineer's Council Representative and Outreach Coordinator
        to learn more about how the club gets funding and promotes itself. Fast-Forward to the 2020-21 school year,
        and I was in that exact position! My duties included representing the team amongst every other engineering
        group, allocating funding from the SEC, organizing and filing receipts, and planning outreach events. Working
        closely alongside the Project Manager, I was able to get a feel for what that role included, and at the end
        of my Sophomore year I was elected for that position.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        The year hasn't begun yet, however I've been working with the Chief Engineer (Lemuel Hook) to get the team
        prepared for the upcoming season. Stay tuned for more info!

    <h3>VT Computer Science Department - Teaching Assistant</h3>
    <h5>
        January 2021 - May 2021 |
        <a href="https://hosting.cs.vt.edu/diversity/opportunities.html" style="color: #555; font-size: 1em;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a>
    </h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        Along with 11 other TA's, I devoted 10 hours each week helping over 300 students complete their
        coding assignments and delve deeper into an awesome field. The course (CS 2505 - Intro to Computer
        Organization I) gives students an introduction to high-level computer architecture and system concepts,
        system software, and programming in C.
    </p>

    <h3>Web Development at VT - Member</h3>
    <h5>
        August 2020 - January 2021 |
        <a href="https://webdvt.org/" style="color: #555; font-size: 1em;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a>
    </h5>
    <p>
        I'm not going to lie - prior to my Sophomore year, I knew little to nothing about web design. Understanding
        this myself, I decided I would join a club that would give me some experience and knowledge on the topic; enter
        Web Development at VT. The club runs on a semester-to-semester basis, essentially giving a crash course in
        basic web design and development. Each week, a new topic is taught from ground zero, and just enough is shown
        that you could figure it out from there. Overall, the topics that were covered in the club (and I somewhat
        picked up) included:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>Version Control with GitHub</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Even though I was only in the club for a few months, it taught me a decent bit - enough to make this
        website from scratch!
