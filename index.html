    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm an aspiring Software Developer, UX Designer, and Entrepreneur from the Northern Virginia
        area. I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Virginia Tech with a minor in Human-Computer
        Interaction and a focus in Artificial Intelligence. I currently hold two club leadership positions,
        plan to serve as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science Department in the
        upcoming Spring semester, and have a Summer 2021 internship planned with AnaVation, LLC.
    </p>
    <p>
        Software design has been a big passion of mine for years. To me, creating a system, algorithm,
        or website yourself is almost its own form of art; the satisfaction that comes from seeing something
        that you made being used and enjoyed by others is second to none.

    <h2>What Do I Do?</h2>

    <h3>AnaVation, LLC - Intern</h3>
    <h5>May 2021 - August 2021 (Future)</h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        Following a meeting with the firm's CEO at the Virginia Tech CS|Source Career Fair and a subsequent
        interview, I have been offered a position as a Summer Intern with AnaVation, LLC
        (<a href="https://anavationllc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their Website</a>)! I'm still
        waiting to hear about the specific projects that I'll be working on, but I should find out soon and will keep
        this page updated! The program runs from mid-May through early-August.
    </p>

    <h3>VT Computer Science Department - Teaching Assistant</h3>
    <h5>January 2021 - May 2021 (Future)</h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        Upon finishing the course CS 2505 (Intro to Computer Organization I) at Virginia Tech, I was sent an
        offer from the course professor (William McQuain) with an offer to be a Teaching Assistant for the
        Computer Science Department. I haven't been told which course or section I would be responsible for,
        but I should be hearing back soon. The position is currently for the Spring Semester, running from
        late-January through early-May.
    </p>

    <h3>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Club - Treasurer</h3>
    <h5>August 2020 - Present</h5>
    <p>
        I joined the AI/ML club at the beginning of the Fall 2020 semester as just a member so I could get some
        better hands-on experience with the field. We went over a bunch of interesting topics including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditional Neural Networks</li>
        <li>Convolutional Neural Networks</li>
        <li>Image Recognition</li>
        <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
        <li>Ensemble Learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        I also gained experience using software such as Orange to better visualize the whole process. Towards the
        end of the semester, I applied (and was accepted) to be the club Treasurer; I serve alongside 4 other students,
        and together we are responsible for creating the club events and projects for each meeting. As the Treasurer,
        I am personally responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        <li>Allocating All Club Funding</li>
        <li>Creating a Club Budget</li>
        <li>Managing and Dispersing Funds</li>
        <li>Collaborating with Other Leaders on Club Direction</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design, Build, Fly! at VT - SEC Representative & Outreach Coordinator</h3>
    <h5>October 2019 - Present</h5>
    <p>
        DBF was the first club I joined at Virginia Tech; each year, we create an unmanned, electric powered,
        radio-controlled aircraft to be applied to "real world" missions. It's a pretty substantial task which involves
        months of work and dozens of workers, so members are divided into sub-teams where they focus on specific parts
        of the process. As a Freshman, I joined the Manufacturing team - we were responsible for creating the physical
        plane from the CAD models.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alongside Manufacturing, I shadowed the club's Student Engineer's Council Representative and Outreach Coordinator
        (Jack Barnes) to learn more about how the club gets funding and promotes itself. Fast-Forward to the 2020-21
        school year, and here I am in that exact position! My exact duties entail:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        <li>Representing the Club Among All of the Engineering Clubs</li>
        <li>Allocating Club Funding from the SEC</li>
        <li>Organizing and Filing Receipts</li>
        <li>Communicating with the Project Manager</li>
        <li>Planning Outreach Events to Promote the Club</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Web Development at VT - Member</h3>
    <h5>August 2020 - Present</h5>
    <p>
        I'm not going to lie - prior to this past semester, I knew little to nothing about web design. Understanding
        this myself, I decided I would join a club that would give me some experience and knowledge on the topic; enter
        Web Development at VT. The club runs on a semester-to-semester basis, essentially giving a crash course in
        basic web design and development. Each week, a new topic is taught from ground zero, and just enough is shown
        that you could figure it out from there. Overall, the topics that were covered in the club (and I somewhat
        picked up) included:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>Version Control with GitHub</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Even though I've only been in the club for a few months, it's taught me a decent bit - enough to make this
        website from scratch!
